<h2>About</h2>
The assignment was to build a website with a theme around photos you took in your local area.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

- Moodboard and a low fidelity prototype must be created before.
- 15–30 personal photographs must be added, of which 10–20 must be on a gallery page with modals in the computer version (this criteria is not included in the mobile version).
- 5-7 pages total, including 1 gallery page OR onepage with 5–6 sections and a separate gallery page.
- SEO includes internal and relevant outbound links as well as the following: title, description, HTML5, headers, alt texts, file folder structure, and menus.
- <b> Pagespeed:</b> try to achieve a score of as near to 100 as you can on both computers and mobile devices.
- <b>Design:</b> A responsive and modern look. C.R.A.P needs to be respected. Not a template!
